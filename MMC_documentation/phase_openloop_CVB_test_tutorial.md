## Objectives and context

The objective of this task is to build a MMC phase considering that we already have two MMC stacks of 5 modules.

![Phase tutorial objective](figures/MMC_phase_tutorial_objective.png)

## Required Hardware list
- 11 TWIST boards with SPIN (extra 5 if necessary?)
- 2 DC power supplies of 6 V with minimum 2 A
- 2 DC power supply of (48 V, 5 A)
- 2 Protection diodes (at least 100 V)
- 2 DC bus capacitors around 4500 µF
- 2 stack inductances around 5 mH
- 1 variable resistor
- 10 ethernet cables
- PC 64-bits (windows or linux)
- Oscilloscope (PicoScope used as default)
- Current probes (10 A peak-to-peak, 10 kHz)
- Differential probes for voltage measurements

## Required Software list
- Git
- Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO (follow [VScode for OwnTech tutorial](Vscode_for_OwnTech_configuration.md).)

## Get base code from VScode

First, we need to load the base code from the stack test with CVB in the OwnTech example repository version in https://github.com/analuhaas/examples 
1.	In VScode, open the folder where you previously cloned OwnTech’s github.
2.	In platformio.ini file, substitute the owntech_examples variable link by https://github.com/analuhaas/examples.git 
3.	Go to platform.io icon ![ALIEN](figures/alien_icon.png), go to Examples Twist under the Project Tasks tab and click on “MMC arm – with CVB” or “MMC phase”.

![Examples buttons](figures/examples_buttons.png)

4.	Now you have the good code to start in your VScode.

## Preliminary Task 1: If not done yet, go up to stack Hardware setup
### Subtask 1.1 - Modify TWIST boards and verify their measurement calibration

It is necessary to modify the TWIST boards used as modules if not done yet. To do it, follow the [TWIST modifications for MMC tutorial](twist_modifications_MMC_tutorial.md).

Also, you need to calibrate the board sensors using the [calibration tutorial](twist_calibration_tutorial.md).

### Subtask 1.2 - Test all modules using both low-frequency and high-frequency test sequences
#### Objective: Verify if all modules are working individually.

To test the modules, use the module [low-frequency test tutorial](module_LF_test_tutorial.md) and [high-frequency test tutorial](module_HF_test_tutorial.md).

### Subtask 1.3 - Build and test stacks
#### Objective: Verify if stacks are working individually.

Repeat for the upper and lower stacks the [stack test tutorial](stack_openloop_CVB_test_tutorial.md). Be sure to verify if the current and voltage measurements of the modules are calibrated.

## Task 2: Phase test using phase circuit#1 (no current)

#### Task objective: Verify if stack voltages are well generated, having stepped waveform, and well synchronized, having 180° phase-shift.

The theorical and experimental implementation electrical circuits for circuit #1 are described in the figure below. The steps to achieve this configuration are:

5.	Connect the upper and lower stacks in series using VLOW1 and GND terminals to form an MMC phase using banana cables (figure below).
6.	Connect each module of the phase to the External Auxiliary DC Power Supply via the 6 V and DGND white PINs (figure below). Use one External Auxiliary DC Power Supply for each stack or connect the stacks 6 V in parallel. Make sure that the External Auxiliary DC Power Supplies are configured to deliver 6 V with limiting current of 2 A. Make sure the power supply OUTPUT IS OFF.
7. Add extra 1.1 mF capacitance in parallel to Vhigh and DGND terminals to increase module capacitor ($𝐶= C_{extra} + 𝐶_{𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ} \approx 1300 \mu 𝐹$).
8.	Connect the controller board and all modules by ethernet cables as in the image (figure below).
9.	Connect the stack to the 2 DC power supplies using the 2 protection diodes.

![Phase test - circuit #1 configuration](figures/MMC_phase_test_circuit1.png)

10. Configure the 2 DC power supplies to 24 V (sum up 48 V in the DC bus).
11.	Connect the voltage and current measurements with the oscilloscope. Recommended measures:
    - Upper arm voltage
    - Lower arm voltage
    - Phase voltage
    - Upper arm current
    - Lower arm current
    - 1 Capacitor voltage
12.	Configure your Oscilloscope (PicoScope or other).
13.	Test the phase using the example code.
    - Get the correct test code using “MMC phase”  button.
    - Repeat to all 5 module boards M1, M2, M3, M4, M5:
      * Connect the board to the PC via a USB-C cable.
      * If the module needs specific calibration value, insert this code snippet on setup_routine() after the "" line. Change the module ID according to its function on the phase.

            }
        ```
      
      * Build ![BUILD](figures/build.png) and Upload ![UPLOAD](figures/upload.png) the code main.cpp into the board.
      * Open the serial monitor and copy the board ID to the identification list in the code according to its function in the stack
        ``` ruby
        /* -------------- BOARD IDENTIFICATION ----------------------- */
